# Rationale for Text Analysis of 10 Open-Access Articles

## Validation of Metadata and Bibliographical References

To validate the accuracy of the metadata and bibliographical references extracted from the 10 open-access articles, I manually checked each reference against the original article. I verified that the title, author, year, and publication information were accurate, and made corrections where necessary. I also checked the formatting of the references to ensure that they were consistent with the citation style used in the articles.
## Validation of Keyword Cloud

To generate the keyword cloud, I extracted the abstracts from the 10 articles using Grobid, and processed them using the Python wordcloud and nltk packages. To validate the results, I manually reviewed the most frequently occurring words in the keyword cloud to ensure that they were representative of the content of the abstracts. I also checked the frequency of certain key terms to ensure that they were accurately represented in the keyword cloud.
## Validation of Figure Count Visualization

To generate the figure count visualization, I used the Python PyPDF2 package to extract the figures from each of the 10 articles, and counted the number of figures in each article. I then used the matplotlib package to create the visualization. To validate the results, I manually checked the number of figures in each article to ensure that they matched the figures displayed in the original article.
## Validation of Links List

To extract the links from each of the 10 articles, I used a regular expression to search for URLs in the text, and then used the Python beautifulsoup package to extract the links from the HTML content of the articles. To validate the results, I manually checked each link to ensure that it was accurate and relevant to the content of the article. I also verified that the links were correctly formatted and free of errors.

Overall, I used a combination of automated and manual validation techniques to ensure the accuracy and quality of the text analysis results. By cross-checking the extracted data against the original articles, I was able to identify and correct any errors or inconsistencies, and ensure that the final results were reliable and trustworthy.
